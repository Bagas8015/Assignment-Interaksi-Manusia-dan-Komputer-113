00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:028,000
Adi : In here..

1
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,787
Adi : we use the InReality application.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Bagas : Yes.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,896
Adi : This application is made like a learning medium for getting to know certain planets

4
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,790
Adi : by using a poster and then the use of AR technology so it seems like the planet appears.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Adi : there are three application menu.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Adi : the first is AR Camera, the second is the HINT, and the third is the poster

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Adi : In my opinion, from the start there is no button to turn off the music.

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Bagas : yes, there was no button to turn off the music

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Falend : suddenly straight away

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,100
Adi : so maybe later you will add a button symbol to turn off the music

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Bagas : yes it can be added

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Adi : do you think the menu itself is proportional?

13
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:55,000
Bagas : it could have been made even better

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Falend : the menu itself in the hint section, it shouldn't need to be combined into the main part, in my opinion

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Falend : Yes, the hint means it's like being positioned like the help button in the corner

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Adi  : So the main feature is the AR Camera, put it in the middle screen
